Built in Angular 1.4

Status: Not Done

## Goals:
- Finish first, tweak second
- Have abstracted rendering engine (allow for ports to SVG or other)
- 

## tasks:
- create wrapping game/app controller
- create auto-play module
- create 'bouncing plums'
- change 'snake-byte.controller' to 'game.controller'
- countdown timer add more apples
- move next/last advance into snake-state
- bind eating to growing
- 

## Road Map:
- build out maps from source materials below


## Someday/Maybe/ideas
- Snake poop creates wall
- incorporate sound html5 audio etc.
- animated level transitions, crashes
